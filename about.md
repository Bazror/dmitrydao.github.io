Devs code, I write. Have been doing this for 3 years and don't want to stop. 
Mostly write for blockchain products because I believe they will win. Can handle tech posts, guides, tutorials, UX copy, API docs.
I also run a Steem witness node and build apps for blockchain communities which is a nice bonus.

## Getting Started

Most of my work can be found on Github.

## Dash

My first gig in the blockchain industry was Dash. Back in 2016, I was the first person in Ukraine to receive funding from [Dash DAO](https://app.dashnexus.org).
Soon thereafter I was hired by Paytomat and stayed there.

## Paytomat

[Paytomat](http://paytomat.com) was my longest gig (almost 3 years). It's a Ukrainian fintech startup that provided an infrastructure for cryptocurrency payments. I was managing their tech blog, helped with UX copy, whitepaper and various 
materials for business clients, as well as mobile wallet users.
Some of my works can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dmitrydao/technical-writing/tree/master/Paytomat).

In 2019 I presented the company in the Malaysian Accelerator Program [MaGiC GAP](https://mymagic.my/gap) and helped to establish integration with [NCR Colbri](https://www.ncrcolibri.com) POS provider.

## Steem

I was a big fan of Steem since its first launch but I got quite involved only in late 2018. 
I decided to get deeper into tech and had launched a [witness node](https://steemitwallet.com/~witnesses) (aka validator or block producing node).
On top of producing content, I started to build various apps that Steem community is using till this day:
- [Steem Apps DB](https://steemappsdb.com) - a blockchain explorer for Steem-based apps.
- [Steem Proposals](https://steemproposals.com) - Steem budgeting and governance system, aka DAO.
