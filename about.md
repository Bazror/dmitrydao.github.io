Devs code, I write. Have been doing this for 3 years and don't want to stop. 
Mostly write for blockchain products because I believe they will win. Can handle tech posts, guides, tutorials, UX copy, API docs.
I also run a Steem witness node and build apps for blockchain communities which is a nice bonus.

## Getting Started

Most of my work can be found on Github.
