# Relocation
Hey guys. Sorry for the lack of communication for the last month. I was quite busy moving to Indonesia and figuring out my next steps.

So at the moment I settled in Bali and to be honest I happy that I did. It was a tough choice but it is totally worth it. I didn’t want to leave cause all of my friends live in Ukraine and I don’t anymore. I can probably get used to it cause hopefully, the technology doesn’t cut the relationships off completely. On the contrary, I feel a better sense of freedom for myself and a connection to the people I do care about back at home. I didn’t expect that but I kind of like it.

Since I’m located in the №1 spot for digital nomads in the world, my goal is to become more productive and efficient with how do I use my time. I’ve already felt the influence of working in co-working space and how it keeps you concentrated on the actual work that typically you don’t want to do when you’re in the office.

# Research
This month I took my time to evaluate what is happening with Steem and what is the best way I can help it grow and become a more mature platform. I was making quite an extensive research this issue and here’s what I found:
- A lack of monetary incentive, an ongoing bear market and a difficulty to become discovered has caused people to leave Steemit (back then we didn’t have such a variety of interfaces as we do now). That can be fixed but I believe there’s not enough interest and demand for decentralized social networks yet and I’m not sure it is that important for your friends anyways.
- Games seem to win. I’m pretty impressed with the number of transactions and engagement that are coming from SteemMonsters, DrugWars, NextColony, MagicDice, and KryptoGames. That is stunning. It works and just because it works so great that it should be a platform’s growth strategy or a winning formula if you would. 
- The trending page is not an indicator of quality content. This one is kind of obvious since there are dozens of bots that can push your post to the top if you pay enough for it. This is why it takes a while to find decent content to consume despite the fact that we have tags. I guess the communities would improve niche selection but only time can tell.
- A lot of talented people have left the platform about 2 years ago. I stumbled upon this issue when I was looking for people who have their location set up to Bali but I just couldn’t find anybody who was active within a month even. People quickly lost interest and I don’t blame them. On the contrary, I want to talk with them but I can’t because unfortunately, the messaging option is not on the platform yet. 

# My next moves
After making the research and reevaluating the situation, I decided to take a break from coding and focus more on integrating Steem with existing games/apps. I’m not sure how approachable people are in this regard but I want to give it a shot.

I will still finish the proposals interface but only after it gets live on mainnet. I’m not familiar with jsonrpc and how it works so I’ll wait for a steemjs lib update. 

I also have a few projects in mind for Steem but I’ll announce them later on next month so stay tuned.

Thanks for your support, love your guys.
