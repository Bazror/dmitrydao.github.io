## Pre-history 

I was born in Ukraine, a country with an amazing local banking system, yet extremely poor international payment system. Paypal, Stripe, Revolut, N26 or any other major player is simply not accessible for us. Having the brightest IT specialists in the world require some form of gateways to EU or US accounts but that's quite a tough challenge for most of us living here. Payoneer seems to be like the only option but it's super pricy based on what I've seen from people who are using it.

Bitcoin, on the other side, is one of the best things I've discovered that is solving all of this. Exchange money instantly anywhere with anyone around the globe. Why to hell not? In 2016 I had this big dream to travel around the globe and share this awesome technology. Luckily, I joined the company that had the same goal and I was partially living my dream. It was awesome. Lots of conferences, business trips, product demonstrations. The best part is that we actually had a working product and people loved it.

After a while though, the market started to calm down and people stopped being interested in crypto as a payment method anymore. It felt like the price was the only indicator of people's excitement. It's not as appealing to pay with something that is going down continuously. It has to be stable or at least going up. This makes a lot of sense apparently but we all know that's not how this industry works.

Despite all of this, I kept my eye on the radar and started to follow traditional finance companies and their approaches to attract new customers. I started to learn the history of different payment networks and test local wallets while traveling the world. Gradually I've collected a set of 3 core things we're lacking in this endless road of beating the fiat system. It's a long read so you can make a cup of coffee and freely come back.

## 1. Scalable integrations
A lot of stuff has been tested by different companies to expand crypto acceptance. Some were offering half-working apps, the others were selling expensive hardware. But in the end, they were pushing crypto from one merchant to another. You don't have to be super smart to understand that this is not a scalable model but people still using it as their primary option.

### 1.1 Point of Sale systems

Early on our team discovered a solution that we thought could cover hundreds or even thousands of businesses with one integration only. We were using something that you might not even be paying attention to, a little black box called Point of Sale (PoS) system. This is something that managers and waiters are using for creating bills and keeping track of the orders. Most of the time, such machines are never replaced and their software forces you to throw up on the screen because it is that outdated and ugly. I know, it's harsh but no matter what part of the globe I landed on, I've seen the same picture.

The good news is that integration with one of these PoS providers gives you immense leverage and coverage across not one but several cities, sometimes even countries. The bad news is that crypto still remains in the gray area and you have to come up with some legal ways for merchants to use this system. Even if the integration itself was as easy, as updating the merchant's software, the part with fiat settlement and contract signing turned into a nightmare that you don't want to watch just for fun. 

Not all but 98% of the merchants don't care and don't need crypto at the moment, they need cash or at least a digital equivalent of it in their bank account. I still haven't figured out the best way to solve this issue but I think integration with accounting systems where the financial statements are done can be a good start. This model becomes popular with [Bitpay](https://bitpay.com/blog/taking-bitcoin-to-the-streets/), [GoCrypto](https://medium.com/eligma-blog/delicious-news-gocrypto-is-available-at-37-%C5%BEito-points-of-sale-throughout-slovenia-3258e1db5cf9) and many more. It works.

### 1.2 Payment gateways

Some approaches seem not so intuitive, they can be explored through networking. For example, during the acceleration program in Malaysia, I tried to sign up for one of the biggest e-commerce players in Asia, Shoppy. I didn't do it of course but that guy gave me an excellent hint. Turned out, it's an insanely difficult and long process to add any new payment method to any e-commerce platform. The way that can work however is to integrate with existing payment gateway this particular platform is using. Typically, such gateways are quite big and serve tons of clients. This is a win-win.

### 1.3 E-wallets and mobile qr-code systems

If you've ever been to Asia, you would notice something very common, multiple QR codes in every shop. Here's a list I've personally encountered:
- China - WeChat, Alipay
- South Korea - Naver Pay, Kakao Pay, Zero Pay
- Malaysia - Fave Pay, Boost, Maybank QR Pay
- Thailand - Promptpay, True Money
- Vietnam - Zalo Pay, Grab Pay, Air Pay, VN Pay

It's a very big market and people are eager to pay via QR codes. That's how they do it right now in any case. So the approach that can be used here is to make an app or preferably partner with the cryptocurrency exchange app and create a solution that will allow scanning a QR code of this particular payment system. Then you simply pay with crypto and exchange does the settlement for you via the payment system/gateway to the merchant directly. This sounds like nuts, I know. I'm not even sure if it's legal but somehow [ZCoin has done it](https://zcoin.io/zcoin-now-spendable-nationwide-at-over-5-million-merchants-in-thailand/). It doesn't work across 5 million merchants apparently but hey, who would ever think it would work in the first place, right?

### 1.4 Games

The gaming industry has been in favor of crypto since its inception. Dogecoin is probably the biggest one that for some reason people got attracted to till this very day. The reason why is because it's so hard to move the value of your character and your pro-rated account into actual money. You can exchange it into internal tokens or something but the withdrawal part is very limited. I'm not a gamer myself but I know how big the industry is and that's why we have to bet on it too. 

Gambling, in particular, became the biggest use case in crypto payments. If you check websites that monitor dapps, you would notice that the top volume and engagement are concentrated there. Why? Gambling was and will always be forbidden worldwide, thus it works so well with crypto. Nobody can track you and the rewards distribution is an instant thing. Such people don't really need fiat, they need a fair system that can allow them to play and exchange money easily without any questions from their bank or a credit card company.

On top of that, games gather professionals and form big communities. And communities are the basis for network effects. Every big player can bring thousands of fans that are not even playing these games but would like to learn more about crypto. Thus, I think both online and offline games, especially e-sports competitions, can give great exposure to a general audience about Bitcoin and its alternatives.  

## 2. Exceptional usability and performance

After establishing great strategies, it's time to focus on the product itself. There are several things to keep in mind while building any app related to crypto, so let's dive in.

### 2.1 Use UI that works

I was always struggling to understand why blockchain-based apps use such weird and uncommon UI. I mean, it's 2020 now but people still haven't figured out that it's a bad practice to have lots of text in the mobile app or to switch red and green colors, or even to show cryptographic hashes. Sometimes it seems that developers don't even use normal apps at all, nor they have a life outside of the office. What is worse, I've seen teams who create everything from scratch without conducting any research on its existing or potential competitors. That's crazy. 

UI matters and we have to adjust to what already works, despite how special our industry is. It took almost two decades to teach people certain rules and standards of how to use certain apps. People will not change because they don't want and don't need to. Nobody's forcing them to try this new app because it's too hard and requires 10 steps before even to start working with it. In fact, 5 years ago I created a habit that I've seen a lot of people are using as well - when I open the app and I can't figure out how it works without a manual, I remove it immediately. It usually takes 30 seconds or so. Therefore, usability matters a lot but people neglect it.

### 2.2 Automatic but secure backups

The only thing that we have to do properly is backups. It's a very important process that nobody loves to do, thus it has to be automated from the very beginning. Apparently, automation can be a bit risky, so I guess some new secure method has to be invented. Maybe some form of distributed cloud storage will work but we have to see what the industry has to offer. Otherwise, people will continue to lose seed phrases, break or lose their phones and as a result their funds. It's a serious issue that is not addressed enough in our space.

### 2.3 Scalable infrastructure

Lastly, we need to have an infrastructure that can handle the demands for billion users, who by the way can be both people and machines. It's quite challenging to deliver products for masses if we can't rely on such basic things, as real-time communication and exchange of information. I think scalability should be a default feature of each blockchain to make it all work.

Along with great technology, there should come great docs. It's not a secret that developers are not super excited about it, so make sure to have at least one tech writer on your team if you're building a solid product that requires integrations with external software or businesses. In fact, the developer portal should be treated as a separate product itself. If you think about it, you're building something that your clients might use in the near future. If you have shitty docs, don't be surprised about shitty reviews of your app. See, usability goes further than you think.

## 3. Targeted audience

The third major pillar towards cryptocurrency acceptance relies on defining the right audience. This is the biggest mistake that so many startups are doing. They want to go everywhere and onboard everyone. Shooting in the blind never works in the long term, thus we need to know who to approach first. Unfortunately or fortunately the audience can be also divided into different types.

### 3.1 Generation 
Generation Z and millennials are a lot more acceptable and adaptable in terms of new stuff, as opposed to babyboomers. Within this group, I would bet on tech-oriented people, aka nerds. They were the first to discover, improve and shape the early apps on the internet. The older generation will pick it up eventually when they won't have other choices. 

### 3.2 Culture
This one I've learned through the ambassador program we were running for almost 3 years. Turns out, each country, sometimes even a particular city, can have cultural differences in terms of payments and even business operations. For example, in Venezuela, in Caracas specifically, it's very unsafe to carry around smartphones due to often robberies. At the same time, Dash totally dominated that place. How? SMS. I know, it's kind of like going back in time but sometimes you don't have too many options.    

### 3.3 Location

On top of all that, we need to think about which areas to target first. There are only two options at the moment: highly-inflated (e.g. Latin America, Africa) and crypto-friendly (e.g. Malta, Portugal, South Korea, US) regions. Once you've defined that, a nice move that I've seen to be working is to pick one central spot. Start small, from one city and expand from there. Depending on your goal, you might want to adjust your strategy and go big and viral in multiple regions but the best practices that scale typically start from a single location.

### 3.4 Industry

Choosing the right industry can be just as critical, as choosing your sales strategy. The golden rule is to go for what people use often: food, transport, tickets, utilities. In general the travel industry seems to be working perfectly. Hotels, flights, rentals are a sweet spot for international currency. But I'm pretty sure there are things I haven't even thought of.

Anyways, I didn't have the intention of creating such a long post but I wanted to share everything that I've learned and have seen over the years in this crypto payments maze. If you're still here with me, I thank you loudly.
